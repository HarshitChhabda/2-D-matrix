/*Boolean Matrix Problem
You are given a matrix Mat of m rows and n columns. The matrix is boolean so the elements of the matrix can only be either 0 or 1. Now, if any row of the matrix contains a 1, then you need to fill that whole row with 1. After doing the mentioned operation, you need to print the modified matrix.

Input
The first line of contains m and n denoting number of rows and number of columns. Then next m lines contain n elements denoting the elements of the matrix.

Constraints:
1 <= m, n <= 700
Mat[I][j] âˆˆ {0,1}
Output
In a new line, print the modified matrix.

Example
Input:
5 4
1 0 0 0
0 0 0 0
0 1 0 0
0 0 0 0
0 0 0 1
Output:
1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1
Explanation:
rows = 5 and columns = 4

The given matrix is

1 0 0 0
0 0 0 0
0 1 0 0
0 0 0 0
0 0 0 1
Evidently, the first row contains a 1 so fill the whole row with 1. The third row also contains a 1 so that row will be filled too. Finally, the last row contains a 1 and therefore it needs to be filled with 1 too. The final matrix is

1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1
0 0 0 0
1 1 1 1 */
